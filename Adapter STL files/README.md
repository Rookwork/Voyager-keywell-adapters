# Voyager keywell adapters STL files

If you are ordering these adapters to be printed for you, you may need STL files rather than 3mf files. This is doable, but there are a lot of different individual models to coordinate, so be sure to double-check your order. Below is a diagram of the Voyager rows and columns labeled according to the stl file names.
