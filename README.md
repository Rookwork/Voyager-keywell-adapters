# Voyager keywell adapters
3D-printable adapters to curve the ZSA Voyager keycaps

Here you'll find various files you can use to print adapters that will make the Voyager keycaps into more of a bowl shape. These adapters may also work for other boards, but the focus of the design is the Voyager.

A few notes about this print:
1. It can be challenging due to the small parts and tight tolerances involved. I highly suggest printing a couple of adapters first to test your printer before printing the full set.
2. The adapters have small indents on each side at the keycap end to help remove them. You can use a standard switch puller. However, please be careful when installing and removing these. Choc keycap stems are fragile and they can and will break if you're not careful to pull the adapters straight off the keycaps. Do not pull at an angle!
3. The adapters in the complete file are arranged to match up with the Voyager as though it were laying with its keycaps down. That means that the top right adapter goes in the top left switch as you're looking down at the Voyager, the top left adapter goes in the top right switch, etc. 

Print settings guidance:
- I used PLA since that's what I had and it worked fine, but ABS might be a better choice if you have access to some. 
- I found a warmer bed temperature of 65-70 C (using PLA) helped cut down on the spaghetti failures I sometimes got. 
- 0.2mm layer height
- No supports needed
- 100% infill for stability

If you need STL files, please see the separate readme in the STL files folder. 

As with any non-official ZSA accessory design, ZSA cannot provide warranty support if something goes wrong. I am providing this design free of charge and also not promising any sort of warranty or support personally. Again, please be careful if you try out this design. 

Special thanks to Thomas Tse (tomtomthing) for the [design inspiration](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5932496), Voyager user Joseph Lee for sharing his version of this, and to ZSA CEO Erez for testing the design and providing feedback.
